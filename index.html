		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<img id="headshot" src="assets/images/Headshot.jpg" alt="Jared Neutel Headshot">
		<p class="p1">I am from Irvine, CA where I grew up all my life. Both of my parents are South African immigrants, so I am a first generation American. I attended a private Jewish high school named Tarbut V' Torah, where I gratuated from with only a class of only 41 students. I then transitioned on into college, I attended UCLA for 4 years, earning a Bachelors degree in Biology and a minor degree in Entrepreneurship. While attending UCLA, I had the full intention of attending either medical school or physical therapy school. After working at the UCLA Arthur Ashe Center and doing research at the Orthopaedic Institute for Children, however, I realized this was no longer the path I wanted to take.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="p1">I have transitioned to coding as I want to use the skillset I learn to become an entrepreneur. I have already started my own business, Teaching Tech, and plan on it being the first of many ventures I take part in.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="p1">A few fun facts about myself: I am a professional Netflix binge watcher, I love to play and watch basketball, I love playing fantasy basketball, and most importantly, I am a family man and am extremely close with my family.</p>
