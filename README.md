## Requirements
1. Use three `@media screen` tags, each with one of these `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px` for each stylesheet.
2. Make the layout match the following screenshots:
  * `index.html`: [980px](https://uclax.bootcampcontent.com/UCLA-Coding-Boot-Camp/01-17-Class-Content/raw/master/Homeworks/homework-2_Portfolio-Responsive/Instructions/Images/980-index.jpg), [768px](https://uclax.bootcampcontent.com/UCLA-Coding-Boot-Camp/01-17-Class-Content/raw/master/Homeworks/homework-2_Portfolio-Responsive/Instructions/Images/768-index.jpg), [640px](https://uclax.bootcampcontent.com/UCLA-Coding-Boot-Camp/01-17-Class-Content/raw/master/Homeworks/homework-2_Portfolio-Responsive/Instructions/Images/640-index.jpg)
  * `portfolio.html`: [980px](https://uclax.bootcampcontent.com/UCLA-Coding-Boot-Camp/01-17-Class-Content/raw/master/Homeworks/homework-2_Portfolio-Responsive/Instructions/Images/980-portfolio.jpg), [768px](https://uclax.bootcampcontent.com/UCLA-Coding-Boot-Camp/01-17-Class-Content/raw/master/Homeworks/homework-2_Portfolio-Responsive/Instructions/Images/768-portfolio.jpg), [640px](https://uclax.bootcampcontent.com/UCLA-Coding-Boot-Camp/01-17-Class-Content/raw/master/Homeworks/homework-2_Portfolio-Responsive/Instructions/Images/640-portfolio.jpg)
  * `contact.html`: [980px](https://uclax.bootcampcontent.com/UCLA-Coding-Boot-Camp/01-17-Class-Content/raw/master/Homeworks/homework-2_Portfolio-Responsive/Instructions/Images/980-contact.jpg), [768px](https://uclax.bootcampcontent.com/UCLA-Coding-Boot-Camp/01-17-Class-Content/raw/master/Homeworks/homework-2_Portfolio-Responsive/Instructions/Images/768-contact.jpg), [640px](https://uclax.bootcampcontent.com/UCLA-Coding-Boot-Camp/01-17-Class-Content/raw/master/Homeworks/homework-2_Portfolio-Responsive/Instructions/Images/640-contact.jpg)

3. Make the position of the header `static` (the default positioning) when the screen is `640px` wide. The header design takes up a lot of room; I don't want it to stick to the top of a small screen and leave no room for the rest of my site.

4. Included the `viewport` tag in all my HTML files, otherwise my media-queries wouldn't function as expected on mobile devices.
